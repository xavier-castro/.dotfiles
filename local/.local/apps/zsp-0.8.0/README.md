# âš¡ ZSP

ZSP is my personal ZSH prompt written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

From the blog:

* ["I built a ZSH Prompt with Zig"](https://dbushell.com/2025/03/05/zig-zsh-prompt/)
* ["Zig App Release and Updates via Github"](https://dbushell.com/2025/03/18/zig-app-release-and-updates-via-github/)

This is a hobby project for me to learn Zig software development.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction!

I'm working on new features as I use the prompt day-to-day.

There is no config unless you edit the source code and recompile!
