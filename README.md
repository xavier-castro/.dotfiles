# README

This is my macos setup with my generic configs. This is assuming a fresh install of macOS.

## Installation

You need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) before the install scripts work.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh # Install rust
```

### MacOS apps

I really can't live without [raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). Complete game changer.
