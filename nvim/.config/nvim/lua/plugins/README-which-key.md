## üìã **Usage Tips**

1. **Press any leader key** and wait 200ms to see available options
2. **Use partial keys** - Type part of a sequence to filter
3. **Scroll through options** with `<C-d>`/`<C-u>` in long lists
4. **Visual mode** - Some bindings work differently in visual mode
5. **Plugin keys** - Show instantly for faster workflow

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Keys Not Showing**
- Ensure mappings have `desc` keys
- Check if mapping is in a disabled filetype
- Verify which-key is loaded: `:WhichKey`

### **Conflicts**
- Some keys may be overridden by other plugins
- Check for duplicate mappings: `:map <key>`
- Review AstroNvim's default bindings

### **Performance**
- Adjust delay function if popup is too fast/slow
- Disable in problematic filetypes via `disable.ft`
